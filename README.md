# COMP-249
Presented here are the codes that I have come up with for my COMP-249 Java Object Oriented Programming class, this winter 2023. 

Assignment 1:
- Consisted of creating a snakes and ladders interactive game. 
- Played between 2 players
- The two players roll a dice at the start of the game. The player with the highest rolls begins.
- At each of their turn, once rolled, they are brought to the given square, however if they reach the head of a snake, they are brought down to a new lower position, and if they land on the start of a ladder, they are brought to the given higher position associated with the ladder.
- The game ends once a winner lands exactly on the 100th square.
- If a player rolls a value associated with a square greater than 100, then their new position is ajusted accordingly.

Assignment 2:
- Consisted of implementing the topics of inheritance, constructors, access rights, method overriding, packages, etc. Also, a requirement was to practice organizing the methods and classes using a UML Diagram.
- The assignment begins with the creating of 6 different packages.
- The contents of each package differs, and some classes are inherited from others.
- The goal is to figure out which access attributes are best used, as well as making sure the equals and toString methods are properly overriden, as well as other methods, followed by playing around with creating multiple different objects associated with the classes, and testing out all their functions.

Assignment 3:
- Consisted of the topic of File I/O. 
- Used the practice of reading files and printing to files. As well as creating binary files and deserializing.
- The goal was to read through a file consisting of 16 different files names, and then individually reading through the contents of each file.

Part 1 - identify the syntax errors in the files, and store the book records in a syntax error file.

Part 2 - identify the semantic errors in the syntatically correct files, and store those book records in a semantic error file. Then store the good records individually in their corresponding new file names, store their book records in their corresponding array and convert each array object to binary.

Part 3 - Deserialize the converted binary files, and create an interactive program that allows you to navigate through the files.

Assignment 4:


All work is original.
